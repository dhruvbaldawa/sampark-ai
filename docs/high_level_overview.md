# Sampark-AI: High-Level Overview

## Project Purpose
An intelligent LLM-powered agent system that receives tasks via email, processes them autonomously, and maintains communication through the original email thread.

## Core Functionality
1. **Email Monitoring and Parsing**: Continuously monitors a designated email inbox for incoming task requests.

2. **Task Acknowledgment**: Automatically acknowledges receipt of tasks by replying to the original email thread.

3. **Task Understanding**: Uses LLM capabilities to comprehend the task requirements and objectives.

4. **Planning Phase**: Creates a structured plan that breaks down the task into logical, sequential steps.

5. **Execution Engine**: Methodically executes each step of the plan, with appropriate error handling.

6. **Communication**: Provides updates, asks clarifying questions, and delivers final results through the same email thread.

7. **Persistence Layer**: Stores all email thread communications and task execution details in a database for tracking and auditing.
